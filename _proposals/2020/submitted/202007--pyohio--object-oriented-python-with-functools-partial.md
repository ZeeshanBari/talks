# Object-Oriented Python with `functools.partial`

## Submission Type

- Thunder Talk (10 minutes)

## Description

> Please enter a short description of the talk to be used on the schedule and talk detail pages of the PyOhio website. This content will be shown publicly.

In Python, **everything** is an object -- `int`s, `bool`s, `class`es, and, yes even `function`s. This has many benefits, but it also allows us to write un-Pythonic code that is hard to follow.

This talk will demonstrate HOWTO design Object-Oriented solutions using only functions, built-in data structures, and the standard library.

After this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of how Python classes `function` behind the scenes.

## Notes

> These notes are meant for the organizers and won't be made public.

I spent a couple of hours playing around with this concept. Implemented the beginnings of a chess game. Have a path forward in getting enough done to demonstrate my point.

I usually have an outline, but at this stage, I'm not sure where I will be ending up. Depending on the research I do while writing this talk, I will discuss inheritance + Method Resolution Order or how classes help you think at a higher level.

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at PyTexas, PyTennessee, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed at https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist

## Talk Objective

> What is your desired takeaway for the audience?
