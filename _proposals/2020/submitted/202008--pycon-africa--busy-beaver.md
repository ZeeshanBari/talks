Chicago Python developed an open-source Slack bot to automate community engagement. We've automated workflows around upcoming events, social media sharing, and providing insights into our members’ side projects.

I will discuss our experience in building a bot for our community by our community.

## Description

The Chicago Python Users Group (ChiPy) is one of the largest Python communities in the world with close to 6,000 members! Slack has become our primary way of communicating with our members; the platform has been especially vital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2019, ChiPy created an open-source Slack bot to automate workflows to increase community engagement. Users can find information about upcoming events; view feeds from our social media channels; and gain insights into other members’ side projects. An open-source community has developed around Busy Beaver with developers from around the world making contributions to our custom application!

This talk will introduce Busy Beaver; briefly dig into the project's architecture and code; examine the future roadmap of the project; and discuss the challenges of building a project in public.

## Notes

While it will be my first time giving this specific version of the talk, I have spoken about Busy Beaver at a few different regional Python conferences in the US. Slides are available at http://bit.ly/busy-beaver-lightning

On top of being a regular speaker in the Chicago tech community, I have also spoken at SF Python, PyOhio, and led a 3-hour tutorial at PyCon US. A selection of previous talks can be viewed at https://bit.ly/siv-talks-playlist
