# Docker for Data Science

## Audience Level

Intermediate

## Description

Jupyter notebooks simplify the process of developing and sharing Data Science projects across groups and organizations. But when we need to deploy our code to production, we have to extract the model from our notebook and package it up with the required artifacts (data, dependencies, configurations, etc) to ensure it works in other environments. Containerization technologies such as Docker can be used to streamline this workflow.

This talk will cover the basics of Docker; discuss how containers fit into Data Science workflows; and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create a shareable Docker image!

Learn how to leverage the power of Docker without having to worry about the underlying details of the technology.
